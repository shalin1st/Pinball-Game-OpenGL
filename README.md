# Pinball-Game-OpenGL
A pinball game made using bullet physics and openGL
Run the code with x64 mode

press the spacebar to use the bumpers(those barrel like shaft on each side at the bottom to push the ball upwards)

each time the ball gets stuck between two shafts, press the number key 6
it will respawn the ball at the top from where it will fall down so that you can play again
but the score will reset.

You will hear different sound effects based on the collision and/or points gained.

when your score gets reset, its basically game over so it will say: "DANGER, WILL ROBINSON, DANGER!"
